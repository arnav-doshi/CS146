HW 9 Approach

Traverse down the BST looking for node p, saving all of the nodes passed into an ArrayList. 

Traverse down the same BST looking for node q, saving all of the nodes into another ArrayList.

Compare the two ArrayLists, finding the last common value (closest common value to the end of the list)

Return that common value.
