HW 10 Approach 

Perform a BFS (Breadth First Search)

Basic Idea: Visit each node, one level at a time.
Use a queue to keep track of one level over the next.


Step 1: Visit the starting node. Mark it as visited

Step 2: Discover all the neighbors of this node, and add them to the queue to visit them next

Step 3: While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next element, record its value into the final list, and repeat step 2.


Repeat this until all nodes in the tree are visited.
