HW 6 APPROACH


To this problem, I decided to create a brute force approach. I first sort the array and create a HashSet in order to not store any duplicates.

After, I create three loops with three variables, i, j, k, in order to iterate through the nums array.

Then I just check if nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] is equal to 0, and if it is, then I add it into the HashSet.

This continues until the three pointers iterate through the entirety of nums and I return the final list of all the values where nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

If the list is empty, I return an empty set.
